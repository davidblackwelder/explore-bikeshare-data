# Explore Bikeshare Data

## Overview
In this project, I will make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

## Project Details

### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I will use data provided by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core __six (6)__ columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

_Special Note:_ The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them ([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your R skills more straightforward.

### Statistics Computed
There are a number of different areas of interest available in this dataset. Here are some ideas for exploration, but feel free to explore any question you are interested in.

#### __#1 Popular times of travel__ (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- What is the most common month?
- What is the most common day of the week?
- What is the most common hour of the day?

#### __#2 Popular stations and trip__
- What is the most common start station?
- What is the most common end station?
- What is the most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)?

#### __#3 Trip duration__
- What is the total travel time for users in different cities?
- What is the average travel time for users in different cities?

#### __#4 User info__
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)?
- What are the earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)?

##### The Files
You will need the three city dataset files located in the `data` folder:
- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`
